# Analyzing-Large-Language-Models-with-LangChain-Retrieval

  <h2>Retrieval Chain</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Enhances LLM by fetching data from an external database.</li>
  <li>Data from the database is integrated into the prompt template.</li>
  <li>Enables the model to provide more contextually relevant responses.</li>
 </ul>
 
  <h2>Conversation Retrieval Chain</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>Builds on the retrieval chain by incorporating chat history.</li>
  <li>Allows for an interactive chat experience with the LLM.</li>
